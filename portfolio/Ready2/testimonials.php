					<p>“Please consider this testimony a recommendation in the highest regard for Joel & Company. We bought a condo in West Hollywood, which needed a lot of work. After searching and interviewing several Contractors’ including Joel Portillo, my instincts kept me going back to Joel and asking questions. What we found only with Joel is that he was the one who returned our calls in a reasonable amount of time, he answered all of our questions and eased our fears. We live out of state and only had a short amount of time to complete phase one of our project due to our work schedules. Joel and his incredible team were professional and followed the strict HOA rules. Joel inspired me to make a number of changes to our project that was not only esthetically beautiful, but also absolutely necessary. Joel redid items that I overlooked because they didn’t meet his standard of quality. Joel made us feel as though we were his only clients. We are amazed at what Joel did in the short time frame we agreed upon. He exceeded our own expectations. We are looking forward to phase two of our project at the end of this year. Joel Portillo embodies everything that you want in a general contractor. His communication, quality, integrity and work ethic and values are impeccable. We recommend Joel Portillo and his crew strongly and would be happy to speak with anyone considering Joel & Co Construction for their project.”</p>

					<p>“My condo HOA is very strict on construction and they were very impressed with your work. You guys are clean, reliable and understanding of our rules here. Board members have all asked me for before and after photos since their unit layouts are similar. My condo always had a gloomy feel to it, but now with the right colors, wood floors, and moulding work it’s never felt so warm, cozy and inviting. You guys are a real pleasure to work with.”</p>

					<p>“We decided to hire Joel to remodel our office located in the valley. We had a new driveway put in and had the exterior painted. Inside we upgraded our staff kitchen and bathrooms, had hardwood floors installed, new mouldings and repainted the interior walls. We are so impressed, the entire project was handled professionally and the final result was a reflection of our taste. They worked nights, which was great! We had no down time. Thank you everyone at Joel & Co. Construction for being professional and attentive.” “Two thumbs up.”</p>

					<p>“Joel & Co. Construction just finished remodeling our 5,800 foot Square home in Los Angeles. we are very happy with the entire process. All phases of the project was done professionally and timely. All the guys were diligent and followed through with every detail. When issues or unanticipated conditions arose, Joel proposed quick and reasonable solutions. We were fortunate to be referred to Joel for our project from a good friend of ours who had a terrific experience with him. We will definitely be refering Joel & Co. to others.”</p>

					<p>Hi Joel, just wanted to say thank you again for all the great work you and your guys have done. I really do appreciate you guys working extra hours in order to get our home done before this upcoming thanksgiving. Still can’t believe we finished a week early. It’s great to come home to a house that we really love and enjoy. Hope you have a wonderful holiday. Also, sometime in early January Steve and I would like to have you over to further discuss remodeling our pool house. Thanks again.”</p>

					<p>“It’s been almost a year since we had Joel remodel our kitchen and all three of our bathrooms. We installed basalt stone and glass subway tile (for a modern look) in our master bath and to this day everything still looks new. Everyone who comes over raves about how great the remodel looks, and when I tell them our total price, they are amazed. We got estimates from other contractors almost twice the price of Joel&Co.’s final Invoice. My husband and I are extremely satisfied with all the work done by Joel and have referred him to a couple of our friends already. We’ve posted pictures on Facebook and people still comment on the detailed work. Thanks again Joel, to you and your team.”</p>

					<p>“Joel and his team transformed our kitchen into a state of the art multi-purpose area. My husband and I are so pleased with their work. We are in awe with our new kitchen. The craftsmanship and style that was designed by Joel should be in design magazines! In respect to cost, Joel & Co Constructions Bid was right in the middle of three other estimates we received. My belief has always been that ” you get what you pay for.” Don’t just go with the cheapest contractor because you will end up paying more at the end. Joel is very unique because of his ability to listen, to be patient, and because of his ability to communicate well with his clients. Joel’s team of workers are clean, respectful, and a pleasure to be around, and have nothing but great things to say about Joel. This is rare find with many other contractors. Therefore, I enthusiastically recommend Joel & Co Construction for any home improvement project. He doesn’t have an A+ rating on BBB for nothing!”</p>

					<p>“My wife and I just bought a condo in Los Angeles and we needed two bathrooms remodeled and hardwood floors installed. We had a few bad experiences with contractors in the past. I am sure many of you out there have had issues with contractors not calling you back, not doing what they said they would do or showing up late and working half days. You will have none of those issues with Joel and company. From the day we first met with Joel, we knew he was the contractor we would hire. We have been blown away by his integrity, a quality that seems elusive in the construction industry. Joel was on time, always easy to get a hold of if we had questions the night before, and straight forward. He genuinely cares about meeting and exceeding his clients’ expectations, and throughout this project I have seen a level of consistency and dedication that is truly rare. The rest of the staff has been respectful, reliable, and incredibly helpful, without exception. To say that Joel & Co goes above and beyond is an understatement. Having worked with them, I can’t imagine ever working with another general contractor.”</p>

					<p>“We are very pleased with our new master suite addition that was built by Joel & Co Construction. Our finished project looks wonderful and is a great improvement to our home. I appreciated the fact that the crew cleaned up at the end of each day before leaving the construction site, in order for our lives to continue without any great interference. The crew was very professional, and accommodating. We have two St. Bernard’s that my wife and I adopted when we first married. We keep the dogs in the back yard where most of the construction took place. At the end of the second day I noticed that Joel had install a self closing hinge on the back gate, in case one of the guys would forget to close it while bringing in materials. Joel knew how much we care for the dogs and made an effort to relieve our worries. This type of quality is what sets Joel & Co. Construction apart from all the other construction companies out there. I am also impressed with the follow up done by Joel a couple of weeks after the project was completed. We are very satisfied with our new home addition and highly recommend Joel as a general contractor for your construction projects.”</p>
